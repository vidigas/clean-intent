## Name
Clean Intent - AI Prompt Clarifier

## Short Description (132 chars max)
Clarify your prompts before sending to ChatGPT or Claude. Get predictable AI results every time.

## Detailed Description
Stop getting unpredictable AI responses. Clean Intent helps you clarify your intent before the AI has to guess.

**The Problem**
- You write "make it simple but comprehensive" — the AI picks one and ignores the other
- You ask for "creative but professional" — these contradict, so the AI guesses
- You rewrite the same prompt 3-4 times hoping for better results

**The Solution**
Clean Intent adds a "Clarify" button to ChatGPT and Claude. Before you send your prompt:

1. Click "Clarify"
2. Answer 2-4 quick questions about what you actually want
3. Get a refined, explicit prompt that any AI will understand

**Features**
✓ Works with ChatGPT and Claude
✓ Quick clarification questions (not a long form)
✓ See your refined prompt before using it
✓ Intent breakdown shows exactly what the AI will understand
✓ One click to use the refined prompt

**How it works**
The extension analyzes your prompt, detects ambiguity or contradictions, and asks targeted questions to clarify your intent. Your answers are used to generate an explicit, unambiguous prompt.

**Privacy**
- Your prompts are processed to generate clarification questions
- We don't store your conversations
- No account required
